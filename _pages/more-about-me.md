**Interests beyond academia**

I am a camping enthusiast and cycling lover. I am interested in finding new trails and places to explore nature on foot or on wheels. I am also a foodie and enjoy cooking a nice meal and exploring the local cuisine of the places my family and I visit.

**Fun facts**

* I started mountain biking in my native Colombia as a teenager, where I raced for a couple of years. 
* I bikepacked in 2018 through one of the oldest roads that cut across the Colombian Andeans -- El Camino Nacional. The 100-km and 3,400-meter trip took two days (17 hours of pedaling), fully loaded with food, tents, sleeping bags, and lots of water.
* I became a road cyclist a few years ago.
