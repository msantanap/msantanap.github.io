I am an Urban and Regional Planning Scholar. My research interests lie at the intersection of transportation planning, equity, resiliency, and health. My work examines how investments in transportation infrastructure impact population groups differently by income, race, and other forms of social stratification. I have more than three years of experience teaching planning methods, including spatial data analytics, inferential statistics, and qualitative inquiry. I completed my Ph.D. in City & Regional Planning at UC Berkeley in 2021.
