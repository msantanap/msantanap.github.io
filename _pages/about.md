I am an Assistant Professor at The Ohio State University with a join appointment in the Knowlton Schoolâ€™s City and Regional Planning Section and the Department of Civil, Environmental, and Geodetic Engineering. I also hold a Provost Scholar Assistant Professorship. 

I specialize in transportation planning and just urban transitions. My research takes an interdisciplinary perspective to study how investments in infrastructures and policy initiatives that promote sustainable transportation impact population groups differently by race, ethnicity, and other forms of stratification that divide society. My work on transportation policy and planning and distributive justice also intersects with questions about land development, and climate change adaptation in the global South.I will also hold a Provost Early-Career Scholar Professorship.
