I am an Urban and Regional Planning Scholar. Starting in August 2023, I will join Ohio State University as an Assistant Professor jointly appointed by the Knowlton School of Architecture and the Department of Civil, Environmental, and Geodetic Engineering. I will also hold a Provost Early-Career Scholar Professorship. 

My research takes an interdisciplinary and comparative perspective to investigate how investments in urban infrastructure and transportation policy change impact population groups differently by race, income, and other forms of stratification that divide society. I am broadly interested in public transportation investment, new transportation technologies, access and economic outcomes, and adaptation to climate change.
