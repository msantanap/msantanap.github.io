I am an Urban and Regional Planning Scholar. My work examines how investments in urban infrastructures impact population groups differently by income, race, and other forms of social stratification. I have more than three years of experience teaching planning methods, including spatial data analytics, inferential statistics, and qualitative methods. I completed my Ph.D. in City & Regional Planning with a designated emphasis in Global and Metropolitan Studies from UC Berkeley.
