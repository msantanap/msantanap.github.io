Interests
======
* I am crazy about cycling.
I started as a mountain biking in my native Colombia when I was 13 years old, and had the fortune to ride in the Northern California Marin County where some say the sport it started. I bought my first road bike when I moved to LA in 2013 for my daily commute to campus and join the occasional rides organized in the city. In 2018 I decided to get serious and trained with my friend Juan to cross the Colombian Andeans by bike. It took us 17 hours to cover 100 kilometeres and climb 3400 meters, fully loaded with food, a 2-person tent, our sleeping bags, lots of water, and some spare tubes (too many according to Juan!). I hope to continue communting by bike until I retire and am currently looking for my next bike-packing adventure.
