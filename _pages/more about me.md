**Interests beyond academia**

I am a camping enthusiast and enjoy being outdoors. I also love cycling - in its multiple expressions. I am interested in finding new trails and places to explore nature on foot or on wheels. I am also a foodie and enjoy cooking a nice meal and exploring the local cuisine of the places my family and I visit.
